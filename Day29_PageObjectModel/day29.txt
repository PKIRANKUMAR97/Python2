page object model pattern :
------------------------------
separate all useful page elements in separate file


1. duplication of elements
2. updating elements

to overcome we use POM

for every page we will create a separate class
page object class contains only page elements of a particular page
 --1. page elements    +
   2. action methods


1. locators
2. constructors
3. action methods



1. in page object class ., we should have elements which are belongs to one single page
2. we should not hardcode any data
3. we should not include any validations in the page object class
