wait commands :

time.sleep() ---
 1.performance will be reduced
2. if the element is not found within the time mentioned , we will get an exception

1. implicit wait
   1.performance will not be reduced (if the element is available )


2.explicit wait   -- works based on condition
  1. more effective  due to inbuilt exception handling
